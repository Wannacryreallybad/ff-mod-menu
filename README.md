# Funky Friday Mod Menu
Originally an Autoplayer script for https://www.roblox.com/games/6447798030<br>
Open source, feel free to modify it to suit your needs!

## What's the difference between the original autoplayer to this mod menu?
The mod menu includes features not present in the original autoplayer, as well as some<br>
extra modifications, including Font Changing, Fake Announce, and 'Redeem All Codes'.<br><br>
*Hint; It also displays your FPS and TPS in-game.*

## Which one is better suited? no-cheats or main?
If you're here just for the font changes, then use the no-cheats script. It's lighter,<br>
loads a bit faster, and doesn't lag the game as much as main would. No bloat, no bullshit.

## Reporting bugs
You can open up an issue on the GitHub and I'll attempt to patch any bugs.

If you are reporting botplay issues;

* What song are you playing?
* What executor are you using?
* What side are you playing on (right, left)?
* What are the Botplay settings you are using? (preferably a screenshot)
* (optional) A video showcase of you using it and it not working (upload to streamable or youtube)
* (optional) A screenshot of any errors in F9 console or Synapse X internal console.

Otherwise, use this template;

* What executor are you using?
* What is the issue?
* (optional, but recommended) A video showing what the issue is.
* (optional) A screenshot of any errors that might occur.
